# Space Shooter Game (Unity)

A fast-paced 2D Space Shooter game built using Unity, where the player controls a spaceship, shoots incoming enemies, dodges obstacles, and aims for the highest score.

This project was built to strengthen my understanding of game development concepts, C# scripting, and Unity’s core systems like physics, prefabs, and object lifecycle management.

# Gameplay Overview

Control a player spaceship

Shoot enemy ships and obstacles

Avoid enemy fire and collisions

Score increases as enemies are destroyed

Game ends when the player’s health reaches zero

# Features

 player shooting mechanics

 Enemy spawning system

 Collision detection & explosions

 Player health system

 Increasing difficulty over time

 Sound effects (optional if you added them)

 Smooth controls and responsive gameplay
